There is always something to contribute for everyone. In this project, you can add your favourite place to visit as a card to the website!

We appreciate all kinds of contributions from core-code contributions to non-code contributions like fixing the site, suggesting a feature, raising an issue, etc.


## How to Contribute?

Contributing to TourGuide is a cake-walk as long as you follow the steps below üòâ

1. Choose a destination whose card you want to contribute, make sure it's not there on the site yet 
2. `Fork` the repository
3. Download that place's image and upload it to the `images` folder. Make sure you provide a valid name to your image file
4. Copy the Card template code given below & fill in the information as directed
   >  Note: Copy & paste the entire code as it is after filling the details of the character! 
   > üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAtmost 3 cards in a row .Create a new row if you want to add moreüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
   ``` html
       <div class="image">
          <img src="images/[Your Image]" alt="">
             <div class="details">
                <h2>[Final Destination's Name] <span>[City or State Name]</span></h2>
                <p>[Add some Info aout the place not more than 30 words] </p>
                 <div class="more">
                    <a href="[add a link which have more details about the place]" class="read-more">Read <span>More</span></a>
                    <a href="[add a link directing to its location]" class="read-more">See <span>Location</span></a>
                  </div>
             </div>
       </div>
    ```

5. Paste the edited template code into the `index.html` file just below the last added card !
6. Please notice if three images are already added in a row create a row class and add into that 
   ``` html
      <!--image row start-->
      <div class="row">
           [Add your card here then ]
       </div>
      <!--image row end-->
   ```
7. Each row div contains 3 image cards.
8. `Sync` your Fork & then create a `Pull Request`. If there are any conflicts with the main branch then resolve them first.
    ``` sh
    title: Name of the place added
    description: Issue no: #[Issue no here] (for adding a new place its #4)
    ```
